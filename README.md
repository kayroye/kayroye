# Hi there, I'm Kay Roye ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in Canada. I enjoy studying computer science and working on side projects on my own to boost my learning. At the moment, I am currently obsessed with AI and ML, particularly anything in the rapidly developing space of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

- **Conclave**: An open-source chat application that enables individuals to interact with each other and large language models of their choice. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kayroye/conclave)

- **MustangX**: A project aimed at assisting students in organizing their academic schedules efficiently. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kayroye/mustang-planner)

- **Ollama Parallel Requests**: A Python-based project designed to handle multiple Ollama API requests concurrently. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kayroye/ollama-parallel-requests)

- **Prova**: A web tool allowing you to interact with API endpoints via a chat interface, powered by OpenAI. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kayroye/Prova)

## Contributions

In addition to my own projects, I actively contribute to other repositories:

- **Ollama Batch Request Tool**: Collaborated on developing a Python script to act as a batch processor for Ollama, similar to OpenAI's batch API. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nathan-r-a-schultz/ollama-batch-requests)
