# Hi there, I'm Kay Roye ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in Canada. I enjoy studying computer science and working on side projects on my own to boost my learning. At the moment, I am currently obsessed with web development and AI/ML, particularly anything in the rapidly developing space of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

## Projects

The main project I've been working on is:

- **Crux**: A project aimed at assisting students in organizing their academic schedules efficiently and finding relevant courses to take in university. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kayroye/Crux-Planner)

## Contributions

In addition to my own projects, I have contributed to other repositories:

- **Ollama Batch Request Tool**: Collaborated on developing a Python script to act as a batch processor for Ollama, similar to OpenAI's batch API. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nathan-r-a-schultz/ollama-batch-requests)
