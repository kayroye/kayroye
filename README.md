# Hi there, I'm Kalan Roye 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at Western University who loves building full-stack products and shipping em to real users. I've won competitions, secured funding for one of my projects, and worked on everything from AI/ML pipelines to enterprise data migrations. Right now I'm deep into DevOps, web development, and LLMs.

## Highlights
